				<p> Howdy my name is Maggie! Im a fourth year as a Art major and Film and Digital Media minor here at Santa Cruz. 
					My passion is painting, photography and cinenamatography, but in my spare time I like to chat with my friends,
					go to the beach, hike a bit, maybe try to figure out how to get better at surfing, and possibly read some poetry. 
					The comupter and I are like classmates you see everyday but dont know much about, just a lot of broad assumtions maybe.
					Some of my favorite things right know are transatlantic accents, Nepolean Dynamite, scary Dan Schnider lore and fig jam .
