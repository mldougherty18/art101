			<h1>**PSEUDOCODE ALERT**</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>*CHALLANGE</h2>
					<p>Our challange was to creaet pseudocode for a quick flash game. We choose to ask chatgpt to create a beer pong mini game, which is posted below. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>*PROBLEMS</h2>
					<p> Clarifiing the pre code command to format the code on site correctly.</p>

						<pre><code>
					//Initialize the Game:
							//Create a rectangular game board with cups arranged in a triangle formation at each end.
							//Set up two teams (or players), often Team A and Team B.
							//Initialize game state variables, including scores for each team and the game mode.
							//Start the Game Loop.
					
					//Game Loop:
						//while (Game is not over):
							//Render the Game Board.
							//Get Player Input for both teams (e.g., aiming and throwing the ball).
							//Calculate the Ball's Trajectory:
								//Determine the ball's path based on the input and physics simulation.
							//Check for Ball-Cup Collisions:
								//Detect if the ball hits any of the cups.
								//Remove the hit cup if a collision occurs and update the score.
							//Check for Game Over:
								//Check if one team reaches a winning score or if the game should end for other reasons.
							//End Game:
								//Display a message indicating the winning team.
								//Ask the players if they want to play again.
					
					//Render the Game Board:
						//Display the game board with cups, and possibly the trajectory of the ball.
					
					//Player Input:
						//Listen for player input to aim and throw the ball.
					
					//Calculate the Ball's Trajectory:
						//Determine the path and motion of the ball based on player input and physics.
					
					//Check for Ball-Cup Collisions:
						//Detect if the ball collides with any of the cups.
					   // Remove the hit cup if a collision occurs, and update the score.
					
					//Check for Game Over:
						//Check if one team reaches the winning score or if the game should end for other reasons.
					
					//End Game:
						//Display a message indicating the winning team.
						//Ask the players if they want to play again.
					//Thank you chatgpt!! oct. 20. 2023, command "psuedocode for a beer pong game".

					<h2>*RESULTS</h2>
					<p> 
						<pre><code>
							// Daily Task List: Banana Bread Recipe
								// Evaluate when the bananas are spoiled/over ripened. 
								// If ripe, prepare ingredients and materials needed.
								// In a large mixing bowl combine: cream, butter, sugar, eggs, and mashed bananas.
								// In a separate bowl whisk together dry ingredients: flour, salt, and baking soda.
								// Combine wet and dry ingredients; add chocolate chips, raisins or walnuts. 
								// Pour mixture into loaf pan. 
								// Bake loaf.
								// Wait for bread to cool before cutting for best cut. 
								// Enjoy bread.  


							// (Pseudocode) high level list: BEER PONG
								// Initialize the Game:
									// Create a game board with cups arranged in a triangle formation at each end.
									// Set up two teams or players.
									// Initialize game state variables, including scores and game mode.
									// Start the Game Loop.
								// Start the Game Loop:
									// Create a loop that continues until the game is over.
									// Render the Game Board:
									// Display the game board with cups, and possibly the ball's trajectory.
								// Player Input:
									// Listen for player input to aim and throw the ball.
									// Calculate the Ball's Trajectory:

									// Check if one team reaches the winning score or if the game should end for other reasons.
								// End Game:
									// Display a message indicating the winning team.
									// Ask the players if they want to play again.
