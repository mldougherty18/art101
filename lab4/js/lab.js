// Daily Task List: Banana Bread Recipe
  // Evaluate when the bananas are spoiled/over ripened. 
  // If ripe, prepare ingredients and materials needed.
  // In a large mixing bowl combine: cream, butter, sugar, eggs, and mashed bananas.
  // In a separate bowl whisk together dry ingredients: flour, salt, and baking soda.
  // Combine wet and dry ingredients; add chocolate chips, raisins or walnuts. 
  // Pour mixture into loaf pan. 
  // Bake loaf.
  // Wait for bread to cool before cutting for best cut. 
  // Enjoy bread.  


// (Pseudocode) high level list: BEER PONG
  // Initialize the Game:
    // Create a game board with cups arranged in a triangle formation at each end.
    // Set up two teams or players.
    // Initialize game state variables, including scores and game mode.
    // Start the Game Loop.
  // Start the Game Loop:
    // Create a loop that continues until the game is over.
    // Render the Game Board:
    // Display the game board with cups, and possibly the ball's trajectory.
  // Player Input:
    // Listen for player input to aim and throw the ball.
    // Calculate the Ball's Trajectory:
    // Determine the path and motion of the ball based on player input and physics.
  // Check for Ball-Cup Collisions:
    // Detect if the ball collides with any of the cups.
    // Remove the hit cup if a collision occurs, and update the score.
  // Check for Game Over:
    // Check if one team reaches the winning score or if the game should end for other reasons.
  // End Game:
    // Display a message indicating the winning team.
    // Ask the players if they want to play again.

//Initialize the Game:
    //Create a rectangular game board with cups arranged in a triangle formation at each end.
    //Set up two teams (or players), often Team A and Team B.
    //Initialize game state variables, including scores for each team and the game mode.
    //Start the Game Loop.

//Game Loop:
    //while (Game is not over):
        //Render the Game Board.
        //Get Player Input for both teams (e.g., aiming and throwing the ball).
        //Calculate the Ball's Trajectory:
            //Determine the ball's path based on the input and physics simulation.
        //Check for Ball-Cup Collisions:
            //Detect if the ball hits any of the cups.
            //Remove the hit cup if a collision occurs and update the score.
        //Check for Game Over:
            //Check if one team reaches a winning score or if the game should end for other reasons.
        //End Game:
            //Display a message indicating the winning team.
            //Ask the players if they want to play again.
