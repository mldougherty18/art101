			<h1>LAB 9 : Libraries and jQuery </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Make buttons to push. Have the buttons complete a function after being pushed.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> No problems here jbrony unless you dont press the button.Just kididng I had a really hard time figuring out why my click function wouldn't work. Me and hannah ended up finding some code online to modify for this lab. The other issue was once the command was pushed there was no way of going back. So you have to refresh the page inorder to get it back to the orginal state.  </p>
