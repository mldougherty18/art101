					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Print JavaScript output on this site.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I had problems with printing the Java on my site. It took alot of trail and error and fixing small spacing mistakes but we got there. We also had troubles getting the console to print the objects. Again it just took a lot of trial and error before we figured it out. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> We struggled a bit more than normal this time I thin kcause we got used to having one or two mistakes rather than five or ten. But I learned more about the process of fixing mistakes this lab. The material is also more complex than before so the extra struggle is to be expected.</p>
